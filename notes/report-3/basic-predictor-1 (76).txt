confusion matrix

predictions made only when input vector /= all zeros


1/3 of the time, the prices are equal, 2/3 of the time they are different

outcome of this minute > this minute

algo spits out false

[[   13  6774]
 [   12 21444]]

outcome of this minute >= this minute

[[27535     5]
 [ 9161    13]]

 slightly over 1/3, prices must be equal

 this makes up the difference between 66.666% and 76%
