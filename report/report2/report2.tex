\title{Stock Market Prediction}

\begin{abstract}

In this report we analyse existing, and explore new methods of stock market prediction. We take three different approaches at the problem; Fundamental analysis, Technical Analysis, and the application of Machine Learning. We find evidence in support of the weak form of the Efficient Market hypothesis, that the historic price does not contain useful information but out of sample data may be predictive. We show that Fundamental Analysis and Machine Learning could be used to guide an investors decisions. We demonstrate a common flaw in the methodology of Technical Analysis practitioners and show that it produces limited useful information. Based on our findings, an algorithmic trading algorithm is developed and entered into the Quantopian trading competition.

\chapter{Introduction}

My project was dealing with stock market prediction.

This project was chosen because of the purity of the data analytics challenge it poses.

how many people do this all the time

\section{Project Focus}

The project and report is primarily a data analytics project and so will focus on the accuracy of the prediction of the stock market, rather than trying to profit from it. Although later when we will build on top of predictive models to attempt to profit from them, this is not the focus of the project.

\chapter{Data}

For this project, we chose the Dow Jones and its components as a representitive bundle of stocks. The dow jones is a large index traded on the New York stock exchange. It is a prices-weighted index over 30 component companies [todo show calculation]. All companies in the index are large publically traded companies, leaders in each of their own sectors. The index covers many different sectors featuring companies such as Microsoft, Visa, Boeing, and Walt Disney.

We wanted to use a set of companies already picked by someone else so that we don't open ourselves to methodology errors / fishing expeditions to find a set of companies that our algorithms do happen to work for. 

The dow jones was chosen because it is well known, and has a relatively small number of compontents when compared to indices such as the S\&P 500 which has over 500 components at the time of writing. 

This small but representitiive set allowed for a managable dataset given limited resources. Although there were only 30 companies, there was no lack of data to study. To test many of the hypothesis laid out in this report, we were able to extract many datasets, the smallest containing [todo find smallest num examples] examples.

\section{Data Sources}

\chapter{Considerations in approaching the problem}

Throughout the project, there are a couple of things that should be kept in mind. All three of these ideas, in their own way, emplore us to keep an open mind in that we might not actually find a profitable way to predict market movements.

\section{Random Walk Hypothesis}

The random walk hypothesis sets out the bleakest view of the predictibility of the stock market. The hypothesis says that the market price of a stock is essentially random. The hypothesis implies that any attempt to predict the stock market will inevitablyy fail. 

The term was popularized by [todo find sources]. He compared the stock market to a coin flip and asked students to try and predict the movements of the coin flip. some believed they could.

\subsection{Qualitative Visual Similarity to Random pattern}

The stock market certainly looks random to the eye of any human observer. To demonstrate this, we generated a random process with similar visual characteristics to the dow jones index

[todo outline generations functions]

[todo plot graphs]

\subsection{Quantitative Difference to Random pattern}

The above section gives us pause when attempting to predict the stock market. If the market is random, then there is nothing to predict. This would leave nothing to do for the rest of the project. However, it can be demonstrated that stock data is indeed fundamentally different to random data.

[todo plot random difference]

On every day from the year 2000 to 2014, we sysimulated an investment on the dow jones index. We then counted the number of days it took for the investment to gain or lose 5\% of its original value. When it lost 5\% of its value, it was put into the red set, when it gained 5\% of its original value, it was put into the green set. The graph shows 2 overlaid histograms detailing how long it took for an investment to lose of gain 5\%.

What this graph shows is that the market generally creeps upwards but is prone to sudden drops downwards.

This demonstrates that the stock market is fundamentally different to random data. This gives us hope for the remainder of the project. If the market price is not random, then it might be worth investigating and trying to predict.

\section{Efficient market hypothesis}

Broadly, the efficient market says that the market is very efficient at correctly pricing products.

It comes in three flavors 

\paragraph{Weak-form Efficient Market Hypothesis}
The weak form of the hypothesis says that no one can profit from the stock market by looking at trends and patterns within the price of a product itself. It is important to note that this does not rule out profiting from predictions of the price of a product based on data external to the price. We will see examples of prediction based on both in sample and out of sample data, and provide evidence in support of the weak form.

\paragraph{Semi-Strong Efficient Market Hypothesis}
The Semi strong form rules out all methods of prediction, except for insider trading. This means that if we are only to use public domain information in our prediction attempt, the Semi-Strong form says that we will be unsuccessful. Later in the project, we will provide results are seem to be inline with this hypothesis but not as good as with the weak form.

\paragraph{Strong form Efficient Market Hypothesis}
The strong form says that no one can profit from predicting the market, not even insider traders.

\paragraph{}

Clearly, if we are to predict the stock market using only public information, we must hope that at most the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis is true so that at least then we can use external data to predict the price of a product.

\section{Self Defeating Success}

Finally there is the idea of a successful predictive model ultimately leading to its own dimize. 

The idea here is that if there is a simple predictive model that anyone could find and apply for themselves, then over time all of the advantage will be traded and erroded away.

This is the same reason for the lack of academic papers on the topic of successfully predicting the market. If a successful model was made widely known, then it wouldn't take long until everyone tries to use it and the pattern ceases to exist.

\section{Conclusions}

The three preceding ideas ask us to keep an open mind on stock market prediction. It is possible that we will not be able to do it profitably.
